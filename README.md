# HelpDeskForecaster
Predicting ticket resolution times using machine learning to optimize IT helpdesk operations and enhance customer satisfaction.

📌 Overview
This project is inspired by real-world ticketing systems like Freshdesk and aims to build a machine learning model that predicts the time required to resolve IT helpdesk tickets. By leveraging historical ticket data, the system can assist organizations in optimizing resource allocation, improving response times, and setting realistic expectations for resolution.

🎯 Problem Statement
Modern IT operations rely heavily on efficient ticket management systems. Being able to predict how long it will take to resolve a ticket can:

Improve SLA adherence

Streamline ticket assignments

Enhance customer experience

Optimize workload balancing for support teams

📂 Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains IT service management incident ticket records.

Key Features:

Ticket Category

Priority & Severity

Requestor & Assignment Details

Resolution Time (Target Variable)

⚙️ Data Preprocessing
Challenges Addressed:

✅ Missing values removed for data integrity

✅ Outliers detected and dropped using Z-score method

✅ Inconsistent entries standardized

✅ Categorical features encoded (Label & One-Hot Encoding)

✅ Numeric data scaled using StandardScaler

Feature Selection Techniques:

Correlation matrix heatmaps

Feature importance using Random Forest

🤖 Models Used
Model	Description
Multi-Linear Regression---	Baseline model for linear relationships
Support Vector Regression----	Captures non-linear patterns
Random Forest Regression	---🏆 Best performer with 77% accuracy

🌲 Why Random Forest?
Captures non-linear dependencies

Performs well on high-dimensional data

Reduces overfitting via ensemble learning

Offers built-in feature importance

Demonstrates strong generalization on test data

📊 Results
Achieved 77% R² score using Random Forest

Successfully predicts ticket resolution times

Supports realistic expectation setting and SLA compliance

Enables data-driven decision making in helpdesk operations

🧠 How It Works
User submits a new ticket

Ticket attributes (priority, category, etc.) are passed into the ML model

The system predicts estimated resolution time

Predictions can be sent back to Freshdesk via API for automation

🚀 Tech Stack
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)

Jupyter Notebook

Freshdesk API (for real-time integration)

Matplotlib & Seaborn (for EDA & visualization)

🔁 Future Improvements
Integrate NLP to classify ticket descriptions

Deploy using Streamlit or Flask for a web interface

Connect to real-time Freshdesk data via Webhooks

Enhance model using deep learning (e.g. LSTM for time-series patterns)
